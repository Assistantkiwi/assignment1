            <h1>About Chieke Chidinma Judith, Altschool ID:ALT/SOE/023/3577</h1>
            <p>I'm a student of the University of Lagos, studying Biology Education and I'm in the frontend track here at AltSchool Africa. I'm friendly, kind, very smiley and I also love meeting new people.</p>

            <h3>Why AltSchool Africa?</h3>
            <p>I got into tech cause apparently it's easy money, they didn't mention the fact that it takes a lot of patience, consistency, lots and lots of practice, remembering the reason why you started and resting enough to not be burnt out. So, I started ALX software engineering program and whew, it was a lot,I couldn't continue, I took the knowledge that I got from my first months there and moved on. By now, I've dabbled a bit, loved the thrill of coding, did more research on learning solo and free programs, I heard of freecodecamp and I checked it out then started and that's where I started working on HTML and CSS and I loved it so I decided that frontend is it for me and here we are. </p>
            <p>I learnt about AltSchool Africa first on twitter through Hacksultan's page then a friend who finished from Altschool also. I made more research and saw that it's a self paced course that technically starts from the beginnning which was what I was looking for after my run in with the software engineering course run by ALX which I couldn't continue with because it was too advanced and very fast paced for me as a beginner.<br /> Also AltSchool is well known and recognised as which is a plus.</p>

            <h4>My Goal For Altschool</h4>
            <p>My ultimate goal is to finish well and get an internship of course but i've also come to understand that putting great efforts and always learning to improve myself and my skills will serve me well in the future. <br /> So in summary my goal, is to be a great frontend engineer who knows what she is doing and continues learning about herself and her skills.</p>
